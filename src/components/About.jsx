            Augmented reality is an interactive experience that combines the
            real world and computer-generated content. The content can span
            multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic,
            somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that
            incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual
            worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of
            virtual and real objects. The overlaid sensory information can be
            constructive, or destructive . This experience is seamlessly
            interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an
            immersive aspect of the real environment . In this way, augmented
            reality alters one ongoing perception of a real-world environment,
            whereas virtual reality completely replaces the users real-world
            environment with a simulated one.
